function wmMask = feMakeWMmask(classFile,mdFile,wmMaskFileName,prctThr,tissueToUse)
% 
% Generates a White-matter mask using a freesurfer class file and the 
% mean diffusivity in diffusion data set. '
%
% The mask will contain voxels classigfed as white matter and will not
% contain gray matter nor CSF and ventricles. White-matter voxels are
% indicated by a 1 in the mask.
%  
%    wmMaskNifti = feMakeWMmask(classNifti,mdNifti,[wmMaskNiftiFname],[prctThr],[tissueToUse]);
% 
% INPUTS:
%     classFile - This is a 'classification' file. For example as generated
%                 using FreeSurfer. The is expected to be anifti or a path-to-a-nifti
%                 The nifti should be at the resolution fo the Anatomy volume 
%                 (e.g., 1mm or 0.7mm etc). The image values are expected to be:
%                 - The white matter is indicated as 3 and 4 (left and right
%                   respectively).
%                 - The gray  matter is classified as 5 and 6 (left and
%                   right respectively).
%        mdFile - This is either a path-to-a-nifti file or a dt6 file as
%                 generated in mrDiffusion. The nifti file should contain a
%                 3D volume with the mean diffusivity in the third dimension. 
%                 If a dt6 file is passed in the mean diffusivity image will
%                 be generated from the information contained in the dt6
%                 file.
% wmMaskFileName- This is the full path tot the nifti file that needs to be
%                 saved to disk. If this is not passed the fiel is not saved.
%        prctThr- Percentile (values 0-100) to use as threshold for the MD. 
%                 This parameter will define the lagest MD value accepted as 
%                 white matter, values higher than this percentile will be 
%                 classified as CSF and will not be part of the final WM mask.
%                 The default value (98) seem to work to identify the
%                 ventricles in the tested dataset.
% tissueToUse   - This inputs controls the type of tissue that will be
%                 kept in the final mask. It is a vector of 1's and 0's, 
%                 of 1x6, in which each index corresponds to the Freesurfer
%                 segemnted tssues:
%                 - CSF = 1, first index into this vector.
%                 - Skull = 2, second index in thi vector. (??)
%                 - White matter is classified as the 3rd and 4th index 
%                   left/right respectively
%                 - Gray  matter is classified as the 5th and 6th index
%                   left/right respectively
%        
% OUTPUTS:
%    wmMask - This is a nifti structure containing the final white-matter
%             mask, resampled at the resolution fo the diffusion data.
%
% NOTES:
%    We  perform three operations. 
%      1. We create a mean diffusivity image from the tensor fit in a dt6 file. 
%      2. We create a white-matter mask forma classification file created
%         by freesurfer.
%      3. We restrict the white matter mask to only the voxels with mad
%         diffusivity below a certain value, white-matter has low MD values. This
%         value is take fromt he distribution fo the MD in the diffusion data set.
